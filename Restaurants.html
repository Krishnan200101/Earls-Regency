        <p class="Coffee-Shop-Description"> Built in 1860, the original manor was the residence of a British Coffee planter. Though coffee grew wild in the central highlands, coffee production emerged in Sri Lanka after the year of 1815 when the British captured the Royal City of Kandy. Two of the H iron coffee grinders used by the British Coffee connoisseur in 1860 can be found in the monumental garden at the Earl's Regency. The two heritage suites found on the ground floor were two original chambers of the old manor.
